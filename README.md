### Description
This is the repo for an Indie Sim game.  
It's a survival indie developer simulator.  
A parody of indie game development if you will.

#### Core Design
You are an indie developer making games.
You have energy to manage as well as finances.
You need to continually turn out games to make a profit, if you can't afford your bills you lose.
Losing sequence is you have to go find a job.
